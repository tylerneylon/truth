{\bf A Poetic Title for This Article}

Tyler Neylon

\bigskip

This article explores the question: What is truth?

A lot of philosophy is poorly motivated, so I'll start by
looking at what useful results can come out of this exploration.

{\em MAH NOTES}

Dearest reader, if you see this section at all, then I, the author,
have made some sort of grave error in compiling and/or distributing this
article. I apologize profusely and ensure you that anything untoward said
about you or anyone you care about was surely and entirely in jest.

{\bf Motivation}

I want to be able to figure out if something is true or not.
Now, later on, I'll lean toward the idea of effective truth.
So I will need to say how this ends up being useful, but I'd rather save
that for a recap at the end.

I might want to say how it's not always obvious what's true.
Maybe that can be the first exploration of the article.

{\bf What kind of truths are tricky?}

We think of truth as the state of the world. But often it's not that simple.

For example, did Greedo shoot first? It feels like there should be an answer to
this, but it's not obvious how to decide this.

This sentence is false. Is it?

There are kind of ethical questions.
What makes privacy a fundamental right?
What is bad about talking about taboo subjects?
When we have a candidate answer to these, we want a way to test how true they
are.

Axioms of math. What makes something self-evident?

Newtonian mechanics. We know they it is a false model, but we still find it
useful.

{\bf Defining truth}

Here is an outline of ideas I can cover:

Ideas for different kinds of truth:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Verifiable truth; like a repeatable physics experiment.
    \item Authorative truth; like an author saying what a character did.
    \item Democratic truth; like a group deciding what's cool or polite.
    \item Effective truth; an idea that tends to produce a desired result.
    \item Evolutionary truth; an idea that tends to survive.
          Perhaps it's convincing, or perhaps it is self-reinforcing, like
          religion.
\end{itemize}

I may want to take this article in a slightly different direction. I've already
kind of outlined many ideas about the nature of truth in an article called ``A
Model of Human Thought: Philosophy.'' But still, the focus of that article was
not actually truth, and I simply included it because I had not written those
ideas up previously, and I wanted them for a more solid context to model human
thought.

The slightly different direction here could be to build an intuition around the
idea that our concept of truth is a somewhat arbitrary and invented idea. A
practical grounding could be in the basis of wanting to know what is true as a
good scientist. And we get to some quite difficult questions such as, is this
axiom true? Why does anything exist? How do we think about abstract
contradictions such as this-sentence-is-false, or the idea of proof by
contradiction?

And one conclusion is that if we want to expand our boundaries of learning, then
we must accept that our framework is not complete. There is a sense that we can
one day completely understand the universe, but this sense is misleading. The
truth is more that, for every testable physical goal, we may one day achieve
that goal; this is different from the idea that for every question, we may one
day have an answer. And the difference between these two is grounded in the
sense that any question we ask may hide within it ambiguity.

Am I claiming that every question/answer pair is necessarily ambiguous? I don't
quite think so. I think, for example, that well-defined math questions are not
ambiguous. But I think that, given any question we have not carefully considered
yet, it may contain an ambiguity. Something like: if it is a new question, then
there may be hidden ambiguity.

[By the way, for myself: I don't think I should prerequisite my writing of this
on any reading at all, including of the Wolfram article, {\em Why Does the
Universe Exist? Some Perspectives from Our Physics Project}. I believe I have
enough background already for this article, and my challenge now is to solidify
and communicate the ideas effectively.]

I'm having a thought that maybe some questions don't fully make sense without
understanding the set of possible answers. This is a vague thought right now. I
remember I had a much older thought that a question is a set of answers, and now
I'm interesting in exploring that idea a little bit more.

I'll consider a few examples, and then I plan to put together a rough outline
for the article.
